//! Runtime for the code that `protoc-gen-contract-rust` generates.
//!
//! For each protobuf `service`, the plugin emits:
//!
//! - `<Service>Sync`: each method returns `Result<Reply, Error>` when the
//!   call is done. Streams are [`BoxIter`]s. The trait is dyn-compatible,
//!   so an implementation chosen at run time is held as
//!   `Arc<dyn GreeterSync>`.
//! - `<Service>Async`: each method returns `impl Future` of the same
//!   result, so an implementation writes plain `async fn`. Streams are
//!   [`Stream`]s. Generic callers (`impl GreeterAsync`) pay no
//!   allocation.
//! - `Dyn<Service>Async`: a cloneable handle that holds any `<Service>Async`
//!   implementation behind dynamic dispatch and implements the trait
//!   itself. Each call through it boxes the future ([`BoxFuture`]) and the
//!   reply stream ([`BoxStream`]).
//!
//! Every method takes its request by value and returns its reply owned; a
//! call in the same process is a plain method call, with no encoding and
//! no transport.
//!
//! Streaming methods, per form:
//!
//! | Method | `<Service>Sync` | `<Service>Async` |
//! | - | - | - |
//! | server streaming | `Result<BoxIter<'static, Result<Reply, Error>>, Error>` | `Result<impl Stream<Item = Result<Reply, Error>>, Error>` |
//! | client streaming | takes `BoxIter<'static, Result<Request, Error>>` | takes `impl Stream<Item = Result<Request, Error>>` |
//! | bidirectional | both | both |
//!
//! An `Err` before the first item fails the whole call; an `Err` item ends
//! a stream with that failure. Inbound items are `Result`s because a stream
//! that crosses a process boundary can break, and the implementation must
//! see that rather than a stream that merely ends early. No stream borrows
//! the service, so a stream can outlive the call and move between threads.
//!
//! # Bridges
//!
//! The plugin also implements each form for wrappers around the other:
//!
//! | Have | Need | Wrapper | How |
//! | - | - | - | - |
//! | sync impl | async form | [`Inline`] | runs the sync call inside `poll`; for calls of microseconds |
//! | sync impl | async form | `Offload` (feature `tokio`) | runs the sync call on tokio's blocking pool |
//! | async impl | sync form | `Blocking` (feature `tokio`) | blocks the calling thread on a stored runtime handle |
//!
//! Each wrapper implements the form itself, so it fits in a
//! `Dyn<Service>Async` handle or an `Arc<dyn <Service>Sync>`.
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! Every method fails with one type, [`Error`], whatever the service: an
//! implementation chosen at run time, a bridge, and a broken stream all
//! produce it, and `?` carries it across contracts. An `Error` holds a
//! [`Fault`] and the stack of operations it passed ([`Context`]).
//!
//! - **Code.** The class of the failure, which a caller branches on. Codes
//!   are open: any [`ErrorCode`], which every protobuf enum is. A contract
//!   declares the codes its callers may rely on as an `enum` next to its
//!   `service`; [`RuntimeCode`] holds the runtime's own.
//! - **Retryable.** Whether the same call may succeed later; `false`
//!   unless the fault says otherwise.
//! - **Message, source, backtrace.** `Display`, `std::error::Error::source`,
//!   and [`Error::backtrace`].
//!
//! [`Failure`] is the ready-made fault; an implementation with more to say
//! implements [`Fault`] on a type of its own.
