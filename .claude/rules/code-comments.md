# Code comments are the API docs

Rustdoc is generated from comments. A reader of those pages does not have
the design package open. A pointer to a document is not an explanation.

## Coverage

Every **public** (`pub`) item on a handwritten crate surface needs rustdoc
(`///` or `//!`): crate, module, struct, enum, variant, union, trait,
associated type/const, `fn`, method, `const`, `static`, type alias, and
`pub` field.

`pub(crate)` and private items do not. Generated sources
(`rust/api/**`, `*_pb.rs`, bindgen) do not: they may stay under
`#![allow(warnings)]` at the file root.

When you add or change a public item, write the rustdoc in the same edit.
When you touch a public item that has none, add it. Do not rephrase an
existing comment unless you are already editing that item.

```rust
// BAD — public method, no rustdoc
pub fn code(&self) -> Code {
    self.code
}

// GOOD
/// The class of the failure, which a caller branches on.
pub fn code(&self) -> Code {
    self.code
}
```

## What the comment says

Do **not** cite `DESIGN.md`, its section numbers, or stage codes in
code comments (`//`, `///`, `//!`). Do not markdown-link them.

Put the **sense** in the comment: what the item does, the invariant, the
failure, the default. Take that text from the docs if needed; do not leave
the citation.

```rust
// BAD
/// Async face of a sync service (§4.3, stage C2).
/// See DESIGN.md.

// GOOD
/// Async face of a sync service: each call runs the sync method on
/// tokio's blocking pool. A panic becomes `RuntimeCode::Panicked`.
///
/// Use it for calls longer than a few microseconds; `Inline` runs the
/// call inside `poll` without a thread hop.
```

Allowed in comments: public names, on-disk paths, error `code` strings,
proto field names. Those are the product, not a document index.
